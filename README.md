### 🧠 AI Integration (Exploratory)
While working on this manual testing project, I experimented with using AI (e.g., ChatGPT) for:
- Generating initial test case drafts from feature descriptions.
- Analyzing bug reports for pattern recognition (e.g., repeated login failures).
- Suggesting additional edge cases based on observed behavior.

This helped improve test coverage and prioritize areas with recurring bugs.
